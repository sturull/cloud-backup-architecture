# Cloud Backup Architecture  

This project documents a secure cloud backup system design similar to what I built at ScieneCell.  
It showcases skills in cloud architecture, storage planning, automation, system hardening, and disaster recovery.

## 📦 Project Components  
- **Architecture Overview**
- **Backup Workflow**
- **Automation Script**
- **Security & Hardening**
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**

## 🏗 Architecture Summary  
The design follows a simple but secure structure:

- On-premise data → cloud storage bucket  
- Automated daily backups  
- Log tracking & email alerts  
- Encrypted data at rest & in transit  
- IAM role-based access  
- Retention & versioning enabled

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies  
- Cloud Storage (AWS S3 / GCP Bucket)
- Cron automation
- Bash scripting
- TLS encryption
- IAM permission controls

## 🎯 Purpose  
To demonstrate hands-on experience building cloud systems, writing automation scripts, and implementing secure data protection processes.
